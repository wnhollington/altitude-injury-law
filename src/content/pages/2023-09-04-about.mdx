<Bio/>
Dear Reader,

Are you a homeowner facing construction defects in a new build or recently renovated home? Are you a contractor or subcontractor not getting paid for your hard work on a construction project? Are you a laborer experiencing a construction-related injury? If you fall into any one of these categories, then you have come to the right place.

My name is W. Neal Hollington and I am a Colorado construction attorney. Since graduating law school, I have focused my law practice on helping Coloradans like yourself navigate construction-related disputes. I am glad you are here and look forward to the opportunity to work with you. 

I grew up in Augusta, Georgia, but made my way out west for undergraduate, where I attended the University of Colorado at Boulder. Following undergraduate, I attended the University of Georgia School of Law on a merit scholarship, where I concentrated my studies on construction and real estate law. During law school, I had some great opportunities to work in house with several highly regarded real estate developers and contractors. I also excelled academically and was honored to be invited to serve as an editor on the Georgia Journal of International and Comparative Law.  

Following law school and passing the bar, I practiced insurance defense in Denver for approximately five years. There, I represented some of the largest insurance carriers and contractors in construction defect litigation and other common construction disputes arising from some of the largest development projects in the Denver area in the last decade.

Since transitioning from insurance defense, I continue to focus my practice on construction-related disputes. However, instead of representing large insurance carriers and contractors, I take pride in representing "the little guy." Now, my clients consist of homeowners, subcontractors, materialmen, laborers, and other small business professionals. If you fall within any of these categories of people, then we would be a great fit to work together. Since 2023, I have been recognized by Best Lawyers as "One to Watch" in construction law and business litigation. From drafting and negotiating construction contracts to handling construction defect claims, I can help you effectively plan for and resolve any construction-related dispute you may encounter. 

Outside of my law practice, I enjoy spending time with my wife and two dogs. We love spending time exploring the Colorado outdoors. I also enjoy spending time fly-fishing and golfing, and always am in search of a great novel to read.

My hope for this website is to introduce myself to you, but also provide you with educational resources to help assist you with your legal needs. I will be regularly updating this website with articles and videos to help you along your journey. If at anytime you would like to connect with me or schedule a time to meet in person or virtually, you may do so by <Link to="/schedule-constulation">clicking here</Link>. I look forward to the opportunity to meet you and to earn your business!

Sincerely,

<p className="font-['Mr_Dafoe'] text-3xl">W. Neal Hollington, Esq.</p>
