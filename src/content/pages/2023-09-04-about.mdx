<Bio/>

My name is W. Neal Hollington and I am a Colorado personal injury attorney. If you have landed on this site, you have likely suffered from a personal injury in Colorado and are in need of legal guidance. While I am certainly sorry that you have experienced a loss, I am glad you are here and look forward to the opportunity to meet and work with you. 

I grew up in Augusta, Georgia, but made my way out west for undergraduate, where I attended the University of Colorado at Boulder. Following undergraduate, I attended the University of Georgia School of Law on a merit scholarship, where I  excelled academically and was honored to be invited to serve as an editor on the <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/gjicl/" target="_blank">Georgia Journal of International and Comparative Law</a>.  

Following law school and passing the bar, I practiced insurance defense in Denver for approximately five years. There, I represented some of the largest insurance carriers in the nation. I handled and defended claims involving catastrophic personal injuries and losses. While this was an invaluable experience, as I learned how insurance companies think and evaluate cases, deep down I knew that I wanted to represent the "little guy" against these companies.

In 2023, I transitioned away from insurance defense and have since focused on helping injured Coloradans like your self in personal injury claims. If you have experienced a personal injury in Colorado, to which you were not at fault, we would be a great fit to work together. I have consistently been recognized by Best Lawyerse as "One to Watch" and will effectively and compassionately guide you through the personal injury claim process so that you can obtain full compensation fo your loss.

Outside of my law practice, I enjoy spending time with my wife and two dogs. We love spending time exploring the Colorado outdoors. I also enjoy spending time fly-fishing, gardening, golfing, and always am in search of a great novel to read.

My hope for this website is to introduce myself to you, but also provide you with educational resources to help assist you with your legal needs. I will be regularly updating this website with articles and videos to help you along your journey. If at anytime you would like to connect with me or schedule a time to meet in person or virtually, you may do so by <Link to="/schedule-consultation">clicking here</Link>. I look forward to the opportunity to meet you and to earn your business!

Sincerely,

<p className="font-['Mr_Dafoe'] text-3xl">W. Neal Hollington, Esq.</p>
