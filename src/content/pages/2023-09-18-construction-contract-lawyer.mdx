In Colorado, construction is a very litigious industry. To successfully complete a project, there are many moving parts, many parties, and a lot at stake. While disputes are inevitable, many times, simple construction disputes can between an owner and a contractor can be resolved through effective pre-suit planning. Clearly detailing the parties' expectations with a good construction contract is critical to a successful project. If you are involved in the construction industry, one of the best investments you can make is to have a Colorado construction contract lawyer draft or review your contracts before you enter into business relationships. If you have a construction contract or are considering hiring a contractor for an upcoming project, please do not sign it or hire the contractor before having an attorney review it with you.

As a Colorado construction lawyer, I have helped many owners, contractors, and subcontractors draft, review, and negotiate their construction projects to ensure that the upcoming project is setup for success from the get go. The cost of a contract review and consultation costs pennies in comparison to the tens of thousands of dollars in attorney fees that you will spend in handling a construction defect claim or other construction dispute. It is critical that any contracts you enter into are well-drafted, clearly defined, and protect you to the maximum extent possible. Feel free to contact me to review any construction proposals or agreements with you before signing. 

## Types of Construction Contracts
While having a well written construction contract is a given for any project, there are many different types of contracts that can be entered into. Following are a few of the most common types of construction contracts we see in Colorado:

- **Stipulated Lump Sum Contracts:** A lump sum contract is the most basic price arrangement. This type of agreement provides a fixed price for an entire construction project. While a stipulated lump sum contract makes it easy to compare bids between competing contractors, this type of agreement may give a contractor incentives to cut corners in order to increase their profit on the project.

- **Time and Materials Contracts:** Under a time and materials contract, a contractor will be paid for all material costs and their labor at an agreed-upon hourly rate. This type of agreement shifts risks from the contractor to the owner due to the unknown of how long the project will take. A time and materials contract is generally a good option when the scope of the project is unclear.

- **Cost-Plus Contracts:** Under a cost-plus contract, the owner pays the contractor their actual costs of the project, plus an agreed-upon contract. This type of contract may be beneficial for owners because of the predictability of costs. However, often times, the owner will not know the total costs of the project going in. A cost-plus contract may be a good option for the parties where the scope is not clearly defined and the owner may need a number of change orders.

- **Guaranteed Maximum Price Contracts:** A guaranteed maximum price contract sets an upper limit on the total project cost. In the event the contractor runs over that limit, they are responsible for the overrage. While this type of contract can be beneficial to the parties in that it prevents out-of-control costs for the owner, the parties must be sure that the contract scope is clearly defined to avoid the risk of running out of funds to complete the project.

- **Unit Price Contracts:** A unit price contract divides each project component into a fixed unit with a designed cost billed to the owner. These types of contracts offer the parties flexibility; however, the owner will not generally know the total project cost ahead of time.

## Common Construction Contract Clauses

Whatever type of construction contract you choose, it is important to make sure that it is well drafted and clearly defined. Any construction contract should provide for the following: (1) it should provide incentives to encourage contractors to work efficiently, (2) it should clearly and explicitly state the parties' expectations, and (3) it should provide for contingencies and unexpected project challenges. While parties are generally free to negotiate most contractual terms, Colorado law does regulate some aspects of contruction contracts. Following are some common contractual provisions for construction contracts and relevant Colorado law:

- **Pay-If-Pay Clauses:** A "pay-if-paid" clause makes a general contractors payment to a subcontractor contingent upon the owner paying the general contractor for the labor and materials delivered by the subcontractor. If the owner has not paid the general contractor, then the general contractor has no obligation to the subcontractor to make payment. Under Colorado law, these types of clauses are strictly construed against the general contractor. In order to create a valid pay-if-paid clause, the construction contract must "unequivocally state that the subcontractor will be paid only if the general contractor is first paid by the owner and set forth the fact that the subcontractor bears the risk of the owner's nonpayment." [*Main Elec., Ltd. v. Printz Servs. Corp.*, 980 P.2d 522, 528 (Colo. 1999)](https://casetext.com/case/main-electric-v-printz-services-corp).

- **Mechanics Lien - Lien Waivers:** Under Colorado law, any lien waiver that seeks to limit another parties' ability to make claims or liens is unenforceable. All lien waivers must be between parties to a construction contract. Further any lien waiver must be accompanied by a statement that the party waiving the lien rights has paid or will timely pay any third part for all debts related to the goods or services covered under the lien waiver. [C.R.S. ยง 38-22-119](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2021/title-38/article-22/section-38-22-119/)

- **Timing of Payment:** Colorado law requires prompt payment for contractors on public works projects. [C.R.S. ยง 24-91-103](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2018/title-24/construction/article-91/section-24-91-103/). However, there is no corollary to private construction contracts. Accordingly, it is always advisable to include contractual terms that clearly define when payment will be made, along with interest and penalties for nonpayment.

- **Retainage Limits:** The parties to a construction contract will often agree that a project's owner will "retain" a portion of the payment owed to a contractor until the completion of the project. Retainage limits are generally employed to ensure the owner that the contractor completes the project in a way that is satisfactory to the owner. In 2021, Colorado enacted [C.R.S. ยง 38-46-103](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2021/title-38/article-46/) for private construction projects. Under this new law, an owner or contractor cannot withold more than 5% for any construction project that exceeds $150,000.00. Importantly, this statute excludes (1) single family dwellings and (2) multifamily dwellings of no more than four family dwelling units.

- **Indemnification:** An indemnification provision, also known as a "hold harmless" provision, is a clause that shifts liability from one party to another. In essence, this clause says, "if I get sued because of x, y, or z, you have to hold me harmless and pay for my defense." For years, contractors and subcontractors improperly used these provisions to hold owners or other contractors they had contracted with responsible for *their own* negligence. The legislature stepped in and adopted [C.R.S. ยง 13-21-111.5](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2021/title-13/article-21/part-1/section-13-21-111-5/) to void any contractual provision that requires a person to indemnify, insure, or defend another person against liability for damages cause by the negligent conduct of that person.

- **Construction Insurance Requirements:** Insurance plays a critical role in the life of a construction project. Prior to commencing work, it is advisable to ensure that all parties are adequately insured. This will help cover a variety of disputes and issues that can arise during the course of construction and after. Following are the most common types of insurance to help manage your risk on a construction project:

    - Workers' Compensation Insurance. Required by law, workers' compensation insurance covers medical payments and benefits for workers who are injured on the job. Always ensure that you are carrying workers'compensation insurance, as construction is one of the most dangerous industries and failing to obtain this insurance will result in the owner being personally liable to the injured worker.

    - General Liability Insurance. Similar to auto insurance, this type of policy insures the policyholders for bodily injury and property damage caused by them during the course of the construction project.

    - Professional Liability Insurance. This type of policy protects contractors from claims involves errors, omissions, or mistakes made during the course of the construction project. Professional liability insurance is advisable, as general liability insurance will often contain exceptions for mistakes that do not result in property damage.

    - Builder's Risk Insurance. A Builder's Risk insurance policy covers damages caused by fire, weather, and vandalism during the course of the construction project.

    - Umbrella Insurance. An umbrella insurance policy offers the policyholder additional coverage in cases where other policy limits have been exhausted.

    - Inland Marine Insurance. This type of policy will cover the replacement costs of goods or materials damaged during transport.

## Common Construction Contract Disputes
While a well drafted and clearly defined construction contract can help resolve many construction disputes before they arise, disputes within the construction industry seem to be inevitable. Following are some of the most common construction disputes you are likely to encounter in this industry:

- **Delayed Performance:** Failing to start the construction project on time, missing deadlines, or failing to complete the work within an agreed upon or reasonable time can subject the contractor to delay damages. These damages can amount to additional costs incurred by the owner in having the project run late, such as financing charges, as well as lost rent, profit, or other consequential damages.

- **Delay or Failure to Make Payment:** The delay or failure to make payment is a common construction dispute. Unfortunately owners and contractors can often end up in financial straits, making it difficult to make timely payment. Worse, many contractors can find themselves in a situation where they are "robbing Peter to pay Paul," where they are using funds received on one project to finance obligations incurred on another. The failure to timely make payment on a project can result in mechanics' lien being filed against the property. Additionally, failing to keep funds in trust for the benefit of subcontractor can expose a contractor to significant liability under <Link to="/contractor-lien-colorado">Colorado's Construction Trust Fund Statute</Link>

- **Defects in Construction/Workmanship:** The failure to complete a construction project according to the contract, building codes, or generally accepted standards of reasonableness can subject the contractor and subcontractors to liability under <Link to="/construction-defect-lawyer">Colorado's Construction Defect Action Reform Act (CDARA)</Link>.

- **Warranty Claims:** In most all construction contracts, the builder or contractor will typically make a series of express warranties to the owner regarding the quality of the materials and services provided. Additionally, Colorado law holds that contractors and builders owe consumers implied warranties that the building: (1) has been constructed in compliance with all applicable building codes, (2) all work has been performed in a workmanlike manner, and (3) the building is suitable for its ordinary purposes. [CJI-Civ 30:55](https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Court_Probation/Supreme_Court/Committees/Civil_Jury_Instructions_Committee/2023/Chapter%2030.pdf). The failure to adhere to either an express or implied warranty may subject the contractor to damages, such as the repair and/or replacement cost to remedy the warranty item(s).

## Establishing a Breach of Construction Contract

So you have experienced some hiccups in your construction project and are wondering if the other party has breached their obligations under the construction contract. In order to prove a breach of a construction contract, the injured party must prove the following:

1. The existence of a contract.

2. They performed their obligations under the contract or are excused from performance.

3. The other party failed to substantially perform their obligations under the contract. The failure to perform must be "material"; minor deficiencies are not necessarily breaches of the contract.

4. Resulting damage or loss from the other parties' failure to meet their contractual obligations. [CJI-Civ 30:10](https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Court_Probation/Supreme_Court/Committees/Civil_Jury_Instructions_Committee/2023/Chapter%2030.pdf).

In general, breach of contract claims (including breach of warranty) must be filed within three years from the date of the breach. [C.R.S. ยง 13-80-101](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2016/title-13/limitation-of-actions/article-80/section-13-80-101). However, since other types of construction claims have a shorter window of opportunity to assert, it is always adviseable to speak with a qualified construction contract lawyer to discuss your legal options.

## Remedies for Breach of a Construction Contract

- **Money Damages:** Monetary damages are the most common type of damage resulting from the breach of a construction contract. These damages may be compensatory for the direct losses or may result from other consequences from the breach. Monetary damages may also be "liquidated" under the terms of the contract, so that there is a defined value for any breach of the agreement.

- **Punitive Damages:** Punitive or "exemplary" damages are meant to punish or deter the wrongdoer. These damages are typically seen in "tort" cases; however, the breach of a contractual relationship can result in punitive damages under certain circumstances. For instance, [Colorado's Construction Trust Fund Statute](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2016/title-38/liens/article-22/section-38-22-127/) requires contractors to hold all money paid to them by the owner in trust for the benefit of the subcontractors on the project. The failure to do so may subject the contractor to direct damages, exemplary damages, and attorney fees.

- **Reformation:** Reformation is a legal remedy where the court rewrites the contract to conform to parties' true intentions. This is often limited to circumstances where one or both parties misunderstoood one or more contractual terms or a mistake was otherwise made.

- **Rescission:** Rescission occurs when the court nullifies or terminates the contract completely. In Colorado, this remedy is generally limited to circumstances where the formation of the contract involved fraudulent or other wrongful conduct by another party.

## Conclusion

As you can see, construction contracts can be complex. There are many considerations that come into play when entering into legal relationships with another person or entity. There are real estate, financing, contractual provisions, insurance, and many other considerations that must be considered to give the project and the parties the best chance of success.

Unfortunately, disputes in construction are likely, no matter how well-crafted a construction contract may be. Unfortunately, most construction projects will involve some type of dispute, even if minor. In the best case scenario, these disputes are quickly and efficiently settled through open communication between the parties. If not, possibly through mediation or another form of alternative dispute resolution. When material issues cannot be settled, one party may need to file a lawsuit in court or before an arbitration board in order to vindicate their rights under the contract.

In this day and age, there is plenty of information available on the internet to assist landowners, developers, and contractors with construction contract and performance concerns. However, like many areas of the law, construction law can be very complex. As such, it is always a good idea to consult with a competent construction contract lawyer to ensure that your rights are fully protected and your are clearly aware of the project's risks and contingencies. From personal experience, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure in the construction industry. The legal cost to have a qualified attorney review, draft, or negotiate a construction contract pales in comparision to the cost and frustrations of dealing with a construction dispute down the road. As a Colorado construction contract lawyer, I have helped many owners, developers, and contractors effectively and efficiently draw up well written construction contracts to ensure the parties' expectations and contractual obligations are clearly defined from the get go.
