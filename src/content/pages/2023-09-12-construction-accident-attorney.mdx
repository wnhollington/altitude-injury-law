## Introduction
Whether your office is in downtown Denver or high up in the Rocky Mountains, most of us spend the majority of our adult lives at work. This leaves ample opportunity for work-related injuries and illnesses.


Construction sites are one of the deadliest places to work. Even though construction workers make up only 6 percent of the U.S. labor force, the construction industry accounts for 20 percent of all worker deaths, according to OSHA. Many of the deaths are younger workers, and construction has the second most fatalities of any other injury for workers younger than 18. [OSHA](https://www.osha.gov/data/commonstats)

There is also a high risk of nonfatal injuries on construction sites as well, with one in 10 construction workers getting hurt on the job every year. A lack of experience often plays a role in these injuries, since nearly two-thirds of them occur within the employeeâ€™s first year on the job. These injuries can devastate entire families and threaten current and future earnings. https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm

## Colorado Workers Compensation Laws
https://cdle.colorado.gov/sites/cdle/files/WC_ACT_2020_linked_0.pdf
In Colorado, employers with one or more full- or part-time employees must have workers' compensation insurance, which covers work-related injuries and illnesses regardless of fault. In exchange, the employee gives up the right to file a lawsuit against the employer. If you've suffered a work-related injury or illness in Colorado, you should know your rights and responsibilities for filing a workers' compensation claim.
